= Why is Chrome the only browser in the basic version? =

Chrome is the one browser that does currently include the Speech Recognition API most of the time.

= Can I use this plugin is my site does not currently have an SSL certificate? =

It is highly recommended to have an SSL certificate in place and serve pages via HTTPS when using this plugin. The vast majority of modern browsers require a secure connection via HTTPS in order to allow use of the microphone. Because of this, a website that does not have an SSL certificate in place and does not serve HTTPS pages will not be able to make use of this plugin completely.
